// javascript is synchronous, blocking,
// single threaded language.

// we want non-blocking behaviour

// js is single threaded
// has only one main thread
// asychronous javascript

//for front end this is where web browsers come into play
// for backend this is where Node.js comes into play

// web browsers and Node.js define
// functions and apis that allow us to
// register functions that should not be
// executed synchronously.
// and should instead be invoked asycnhronously when some kind of event occurs.

// you could let your code do several things at the same time without stopping or blocking your main thread.
