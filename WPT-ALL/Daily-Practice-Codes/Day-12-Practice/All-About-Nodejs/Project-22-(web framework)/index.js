//web framework

// A framework simply abstracts the lower level code allowing you to focus on the requirements than the code itself.

// for example, angular, react,vue are all
// frameworks/libaries that help you build
// user interfaces without having to rely on the lower level DOM API in js. 

// there are frameworks to build web or mobile applications without having to rely on the HTTP module in NodeJS. 
// eg., express,nest,hapi,koa and sails.

// They build on the top of the HTTP module 
// making it easier for you to implement all the features.
