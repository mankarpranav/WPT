        // With asynchronous programming, JavaScript programs can start long-running tasks, and continue running other tasks in paralell.
        //But, asynchronus programmes are difficult to write and difficult to debug.
        // Because of this, most modern asynchronous JavaScript methods don't use callbacks. Instead, in JavaScript, asynchronous programming is solved using Promises instead.
